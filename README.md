My new nifty webapp


## Usage
While developing, you will probably rely mostly on `npm start`.  Here are some of the other useful commands:  

|`npm run <script>`|Description|
|:------------------|:-----------|
|`start`|Serves your app at `localhost:3000`.|
|`dev`|Same as `npm start`, but runs the dev server with Hot Module Reloading enabled.|
|`build`|Compiles the application to disk (`/dist` by default).|
|`watch`|Same as `npm run build` but watches for file changes and re-compiles accordingly.|
|`clean`|Deletes the `/dist` directory.|
|`lint`|Lint all `.js` files.|

For the full list, see the scripts section of `package.json`
